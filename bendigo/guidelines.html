        <h1>Our Please and Thank You’s</h1>
        <p>For over 150 years, at Bendigo Bank we have strived to feed into the prosperity of the Communities we serve rather than feed off it. We think that being a valuable community member relies on open and honest communication and an understanding of shared hopes and aspirations.</p>
        <p>We have set up this Facebook page as a place we can talk, share stories, ask questions and where you can discuss the things your community is working to achieve.</p>
        
        <h1>Please</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Feel free to share your Community Bank partnership stories and the ways in which you are working together to impact outcomes in your community;</li>
          <li>Feel free to ask us questions about accounts or financial aspirations but remember that we can’t discuss personal or sensitive information on a public platform;</li>
          <li>Don’t include any personal or sensitive information such as your account number, address, phone number or tax file number;</li>
